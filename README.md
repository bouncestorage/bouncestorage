Bounce Storage
==============

Bounce Storage explored management of object store data between public and
private clouds.  The core of this code might prove useful to developers solving
similar problems.  The most immediately useful bits to users are our collection
of protocol translators:

* [S3Proxy](https://github.com/andrewgaul/s3proxy)
* [SwiftProxy](https://github.com/bouncestorage/swiftproxy)
* [GlacierProxy](https://github.com/bouncestorage/glacier-proxy)

Bounce ceased operations in late 2015.  Thank you to all our customers,
investors, and friends for your feedback and support!
